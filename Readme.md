# Prototive of PL project

## Problem
There are several programming languages to start introducing in the world of programming,
and some are easier to learn than others. However, it could not be easy for a person whose
focus to understand a domain-specific language to his/her project without having a
background in programming.
 
## Proposal

I will create simple commands to generate some simples programs. To make the language, I
will use python to execute the lexer and parser. It will help me to join with the adb. The
cellphone with Android OS is necessary to prove the programs designed by my programming
language.

## Objetive
This programming language aims to help people without any knowledge about adb to
understand better how to work with this tool and create simple programs using it.
